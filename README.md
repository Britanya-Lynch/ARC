The ARC is a partial implementation of a website designed to demonstrate how a digital booking system for a barber shop would function. It aims to reduce inefficiencies commonly found in traditional appointment methods, particularly those relying on phone calls. Many barbers today struggle with tracking verbal bookings, often forgetting who scheduled appointments and at what time. This system offers a more efficient and modern alternative by allowing clients to select their preferred barber, choose a desired hairstyle, and view real-time availability. New clients can also browse barber portfolios and view ratings assigned by past customers, making the booking process more transparent and user-friendly as we transition into a more digital era.
